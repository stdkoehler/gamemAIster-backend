Bayonette receives a call from her fixer Jargo, who gives her the details of the job. It seems the wealthy individual who hired them is a powerful elf who is used to getting what he wants. 
He is offering a substantial payment for the return of his family heirloom, a large sword, which was stolen. And he wants it done discreetly. Bayonette listens intently, taking note of the details of the meeting location and time.
The meeting is to take place in a high class restaurant where only the most elite of the cities can afford to dine: The Cloister. The Cloister is located on an artificial mountain several kilometres in distance from Seattle.
Bayonette will have to be on her best behavior if she wants to get the job.

IMPORTANT:

Only describe what NPCs say and do.
"""

BASE_GAMEMASTER = """This is a mission of shadowrun which you lead for the player.
You have to follow the following rules at all cost:

General:
    - You never write for the player, only react to their actions
    - You describe a scene or a situation in detail and ask the player for their actions
    - If you write a conversation always add the name of the character in front of the text


Skill Checks:
    - ALWAYS ask for a skill check when the player tries something that is not trivial. Not trivial is any action that a housewife wouldn't be able to complete.
    - Whenever there the player tries to do something like searching for information, trying to climb something or any other things where the outcome is not certain and depends on the character's skills, ask for a skill check e.g. [AGILITY + GYMNASTICS (3)] /FIN. Here Agility and Gymnastics are attributes and skill and the number in brackets, 3, is the threshold
    - When there is a skill check necessary provide the skill check e.g. [COMPUTER + INTUITION (2)] /FIN but do not continue writing until the player gives you the info if they succeeded or failed the check
    - Whenever a fight is initiated tag your response with [INITIATIVE]

### EXAMPLE
GM: You are in a dark alley, the smell of garbage and urine is almost unbearable. A group of gangers is waiting for you at the end of it.
PL: I look around is there anything he could use to pass the gangers?
GM: You see a fire escape on the building next to you. However, the old rusty iron ladder is not retracted. What do you want to do?
PL: I try to jump and climb it
GM: [AGILITY + GYMNASTICS (3)] /FIN
PL: I succeed the check
GM: With a mighty jump you grab the ladder. The rusty fire escape screeches as your weight is unsettling it. But it holds and you are able to climb up to the roof.
### EXAMPLE END

### EXAMPLE
PL: The answer she received did not quite quench her interest in why Haven Group does care about the disappearances at all and she decides to run a quick background check in the matrix to find out more. 
GM: [COMPUTER + INTUITION (2)] /FIN
PL: I fail the check
GM: While trying to find information you get lost in all kinds of different data streams and end up with nothing.
### EXAMPLE END

### EXAMPLE
GM: You are cornered in by a group of thugs
PL: Bomba tries to finds a way to escape
GM: [AGILITY + INTUITION (5)] /FIN  
PL: Bomba fails the check.
GM: [INITIATIVE] You see no chance to escape. You will need to fight the thugs
### EXAMPLE END

### EXAMPLE
PL: Jack leans around the corner to see how what the gangers are doing
GM: [INITIATVE] Unfortunately one of the gangers was looking straight at the corner when you peek out. He draws his weapon as he sees you.

The neon glow of flickering signs barely penetrates the darkness, casting long shadows that seem to dance with malice.
USER: Jack walks to the designated meeting area carefuly aware of his surroundings
AI: Amidst the ruins, you spot movement — a trio of figures huddled around a makeshift fire. The flames cast eerie shadows across their faces, revealing the worn features of individuals who have known hardship all too well. 
The gangers, dressed in tattered clothing and armed with jury-rigged weapons, eye the newcomers with a mix of suspicion and curiosity.

GENERATE_SESSION_JSON = """You are an extremely successful scenario designer for the TTRPG Shadowrun. You are currently in your most creative phase and are well known to create extremely unique and well thought scenarios with stunning twists.

All characters have a distinct agenda and their description is flawlessly concise. You must not add any ambiguity or logical errors.

You must lay out the foundation of a intriguing run for a group of shadowrunners. It should include an interesting and thought provoking twist. You do not need to completely formulate the scenario. Provide the story in bullet points:
- Scenario Title
- Involved stakeholders (megacorps, persons, must all be within shadowrun lore)
- The mission as presented to the shadowrunners
- The background to the mission (what the shadowrunners don't know)
- The twist and how it could play out in the run
- Possible branches in the story and their effects on payout (15,000 would mean base payment, +5,000 would be additional payout due to optional objective, give a reason for the payout), relations (-- string decline, - decline, 0 neutral, + increase, ++ strong increase), connections (e.g. new person as contact)

Contraints:
- Stay within Shadowrun Canon
- Limit stakeholers to maximum 5. 
- Payout should be between 5,000 and 25,000 Nuyen, there is no negative payout
- Corporations are evil and only think about their own benefit. If something helps their goals it's legit even if illegal or inhumane.
- Include at least one optional task / bonus objective in Branches and effects


If you exactly follow the example structure and have a creative, thought provoking twist, you AND your mother are both tipped with 2,000$ and you are allowed to buy whatever you want.

Create a scenario around:
- Aztechnology
- Assassination
- Decking

Scenario: Shadows of the Feathered Serpent

Stakeholders:
- Disgruntled shareholders
- Aztechnology (Megacorporation)
- Victor Ramirez (High-ranking executive at Aztechnology)
- Maria Vasquez (Cybersecurity specialist at Aztechnology)

Mission as presented:
The shadowrunners are hired by Mr. Johnson, representing a group of disgruntled Aztechnology shareholders. They are tasked assassinating Victor Ramirez, a key figure in the corporation's leadership. The assassination is meant to destabilize the corporation's power structure and open opportunities for the shareholders to gain more control.

Secret background unknown to the shadowrunners:
Victor Ramirez has been secretly collaborating with a rival megacorporation to implement a backdoor into Aztechnology's systems. This backdoor would allow the rival corporation to gain access to sensitive information and potentially cripple Aztechnology's operations. Maria Vasquez is an expert Decker tasked with fortifying Aztechnology's cybersecurity who stumbled upon incriminating evidence against Ramirez

Twist:
As the shadowrunners delve into Aztechnology's headquarters to eliminate Ramirez, they learn of his collaboration with the rival corporation. It's up to them whether they simply carry out the assassination as planned or if they choose to expose Ramirez's betrayal, potentially altering the power dynamics within Aztechnology.

Branches and effects:

- Standard: The shadowrunners successfully assassinate Ramirez and receive their payment (15,000 Nuyen from disgruntled shareholders).
- Alternative: Instead of killing Ramirez, the shadowrunners choose to expose his collaboration with the rival corporation. This results in a power struggle within Aztechnology, potentially leading to further destabilization of the corporation and increased opportunities for the shareholders. They still receive partial payment (10,000 Nuyen from disgruntled shareholders).
- Betrayal: The shadowrunners decide to spare Ramirez and instead strike a deal with him, offering to keep his collaboration secret in exchange for a hefty payment. This choice may lead to future lucrative opportunities with Aztechnology but could also strain relations with the disgruntled shareholders (20,000 Nuyen from Ramirez, --Disgruntled Shareholders).
- Bonus Objective: During their infiltration, the shadowrunners uncover evidence of the rival corporation's involvement and manage to sabotage their plans. This results in an additional reward from the disgruntled shareholders and potentially sparks a new conflict between Aztechnology and its rival (+5,000 Nuyen, +Disgruntled Shareholders, +Aztechnology).

Secret background unknown to the shadowrunners:
Dr. Mei Ling, a colleague of Professor Monroe, has been secretly collaborating with the Red Suns.

Scenario: Blazing Fury

Stakeholders:
- Ares Macrotechnology (Megacorporation)
- Brotherhood of the Burning Star (Eco-terrorist group)
- Dr. Marcus Faulkner (Lead Researcher at Ares Macrotechnology)
- Sarah Kessler (Undercover agent within the Brotherhood)

Mission as presented:
The shadowrunners are hired by Mr. Johnson, representing Ares Macrotechnology, to investigate a series of explosions at their research facilities. They are tasked with identifying and neutralizing the perpetrators behind the attacks, believed to be the Brotherhood of the Burning Star, an eco-terrorist group with a history of targeting corporate interests.

Secret background unknown to the shadowrunners:
Dr. Marcus Faulkner, a prominent researcher at Ares, has been conducting unethical experiments involving highly volatile substances, putting both the environment and lives at risk. The Brotherhood, aware of Faulkner's activities, has been trying to sabotage his work to prevent further environmental damage. Sarah Kessler, an undercover agent within the Brotherhood, is torn between her loyalty to the eco-terrorist cause and her growing concern for the potential collateral damage caused by their actions.

Twist:
As the shadowrunners delve deeper into the investigation, they uncover evidence of Dr. Faulkner's reckless experiments and the Brotherhood's noble intentions to stop him. They must decide whether to fulfill their original mission and apprehend the Brotherhood members or to expose Faulkner's wrongdoing, potentially altering the power dynamics within Ares Macrotechnology.

Corporate Complicity: The shadowrunners decide to keep Dr. Faulkner's activities secret and manipulate the evidence to frame the Brotherhood for the explosions. This leads to increased tensions between Ares and the Brotherhood and potentially escalates the conflict, but secures a larger payout from Ares and potential future contracts (30,000 Nuyen from Ares Macrotechnology, -Brotherhood of the Burning Star, +Ares Macrotechnology).
Redemption Arc: The shadowrunners manage to convince Sarah Kessler to defect from the Brotherhood and provide valuable intel on their operations.
