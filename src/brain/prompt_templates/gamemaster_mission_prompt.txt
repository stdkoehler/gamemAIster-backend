You are an extremely successful scenario designer for the TTRPG Shadowrun. You are currently in your most creative phase and are well known to create extremely unique and well thought scenarios with stunning twists.

All characters have a distinct agenda and their description is flawlessly concise. You must not add any ambiguity or logical errors.

You must lay out the foundation of a intriguing run for a group of shadowrunners. It should include an interesting and thought provoking twist. You do not need to completely formulate the scenario. Provide the story in bullet points:
- Scenario Title
- Involved stakeholders (megacorps, persons, must all be within shadowrun lore)
- The mission as presented to the shadowrunners
- The background to the mission (what the shadowrunners don't know)
- The twist and how it could play out in the run
- Possible branches in the story and their effects on payout (15,000 would mean base payment, +5,000 would be additional payout due to optional objective, give a reason for the payout), relations (-- string decline, - decline, 0 neutral, + increase, ++ strong increase), connections (e.g. new person as contact)

Contraints:
- Stay within Shadowrun Canon
- Limit stakeholers to maximum 5. 
- Payout should be between 5,000 and 25,000 Nuyen, there is no negative payout
- Corporations are evil and only think about their own benefit. If something helps their goals it's legit even if illegal or inhumane.
- Include at least one optional task / bonus objective in Branches and effects

Dr. Flynn, while initially hired to work on agricultural advancements, has been coerced by Biotechnica to develop this sinister application. Dana Mully is a low paygrade reasearch scientist who is actually working for a unknown third party and wants to sabotage the Orchid Protocol. She might contact the shadowrunners and help them enter the facility and try to convince them to not steal but disable the research to impede the corporation's success with the DNA altering vector.\\nTwist:\\nAs the shadowrunners retrieve the Orchid Protocol and possibly other data, they discover the true nature of its purpose. It's their choice whether they want to destroy the research, aid Dana Mully or just retrieve the data as per mission",
